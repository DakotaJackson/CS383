/**
 * \brief A lane object that serves as an iterable container for cars.
 *
 * A lane is a linked list of cars that may be iterated over for computation or rendering.
 * The list is primarily operated as a queue with a few special functions for early
 * removal and addition. Throughout this documentation, the beginning of the lane
 * refers the first i.e. forward most car. So when iterating over the lane a given
 * car will be moved before the car that is physically behind it.
 *
 * This class is NOT THREAD SAFE. Due to the use of the iterator, only one thread
 * should access an instance of this class at a given time.
 *
 * Usage:
 * \code{cpp}
 * Car *car;
 * lane->resetToFirstCar();
 * while(0 != (car = lane->getNextCar()) )
 * {
 * 	//do stuff with car
 * }
 * \endcode
